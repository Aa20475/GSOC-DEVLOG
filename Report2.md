## HEY!


So the final week! Some small but crucial things left! 

I am currently working to my fullest to complete as much as possible! 




## What's done :

* Basic Motion Matching is working with Pose and Trajectory matching!

* Exposed controllable variables to user.

* UI is done.(almost)


## What's left:

* Adding velocity matching.

* Replacing Brute force with KDTree for Trajectory .

* Blending between chosen frames.

* Perfecting prediction mechanism.
