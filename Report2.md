##HEY!


So the final week! I am currently working to my fullest to complete as much as possible! 

I was unable to make as much progress. But hope will make something usable by the end.



## What's done :

* Basic Motion Matching is working with Pose and Trajectory matching!

* Exposed controllable variables to user.

* UI is done.


## What's left:

* Adding velocity matching.

* Adding past data consideration.

* Replacing Brute force with KDTree for Trajectory and pre -calculating the distances between various poses to reduce computational power.
