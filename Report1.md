## Introduction

Hey! This is Aditya Abhiram aka **DestinyGamer**. I am working on Implementation of Motion Matching in Godot.

Godot, being an open source game engine, was built with a *never-ending wish of adding new features to it*.

Motion Matching is one of the latest features in Game Animation which is quite revolutionary. Usually, setting up a basic animation system needs a lot of work and time. Even after that, we barely manage to make a perfect one. Motion matching, on the other hand is a method where the computer chooses the best pose for each frame by itself from a huge database of mocap data using some Algorithm.

>Choose the best pose for each frame and jump to it!

#### This wonderful feature needs to be included in Godot!
